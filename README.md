AnUitor

AnUitor is a result of my rebranding experiences of one android app what i was working on. Because of structure of project(s), not using themes, complexity of UI and app itself, it was really hell and time consuming work to finish app rebranding. Project structure had been done like sub-projects, because of big amount of different assets, logic, etc. I found out also AnUitor very useful in time of UI refactoring/bugfixing other apps what i didn't know much deeply from UI perspective.
